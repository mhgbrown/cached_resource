# CachedResource ![Tests](https://github.com/mhgbrown/cached_resource/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)

CachedResource is a Ruby gem whose goal is to increase the performance of interacting with web services via ActiveResource by caching responses based on request parameters.  It can help reduce the lag created by making repeated requests across a network.

## Installation

```ruby
gem install cached_resource
```

## Compatibility

CachedResource is designed to be framework agnostic, but will hook into Rails for caching and logging if available. CachedResource supports the following ActiveSupport/Rails (right) and Ruby (down) version combinations:

| | 🛤️ 4.2 | 🛤️ 5.0 | 🛤️ 5.1 | 🛤️ 6.0 | 🛤️ 6.1 | 🛤️ 7.0 |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 💎 1.9   | ✅   |     |     |     |     |     |
| 💎 2.2   | ✅   |     |     |     |     |     |
| 💎 2.3   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |     |     |     |
| 💎 2.4   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |     |     |     |
| 💎 2.5   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |     |
| 💎 2.7   |     | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |
| 💎 3.0   |     |     |     | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |
| 💎 3.1   |     |     |     | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |
| 💎 3.2   |     |     |     | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |


## Configuration

**Set up CachedResource across all ActiveResources:**

```ruby
class ActiveResource::Base
  cached_resource
end
```

Or set up CachedResource for a single class:

```ruby
class MyActiveResource < ActiveResource::Base
  cached_resource
end
```

### Options
CachedResource accepts the following options:

* `:enabled` Default: `true`
* `:ttl` The time in seconds until the cache should expire. Default: `604800`
* `:race_condition_ttl` The race condition ttl, to prevent [dog pile effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_stampede) or [cache stampede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_stampede). Default: 86400
* `:ttl_randomization` Enable ttl randomization. Default: `false`
* `:ttl_randomization_scale` A Range from which a random value will be selected to scale the ttl. Default: `1..2`
* `:collection_synchronize` Use collections to generate cache entries for individuals.  Update the existing cached principal collection when retrieving subsets of the principal collection or individuals.  Default: `false`
* `:collection_arguments` The arguments that identify the principal collection request. Default: `[:all]`
* `:logger` The logger to which CachedResource messages should be written. Default: The `Rails.logger` if available, or an `ActiveSupport::Logger`
* `:cache` The cache store that CacheResource should use. Default: The `Rails.cache` if available, or an `ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore`
* `:cache_collections` Set to false to always remake a request for collections. Default: `true`

You can set them like this:

```ruby
cached_resource :cache => MyCacheStore.new, :ttl => 60, :collection_synchronize => true, :logger => MyLogger.new
```

You can also change them on the fly.

Turn CachedResource off.  This will cause all responses to be retrieved normally (i.e. via the network). All responses will still be cached.

```ruby
  MyActiveResource.cached_resource.off!
```

Turn CachedResource on.
```ruby
MyActiveResource.cached_resource.on!
```

Set the cache expiry time to 60 seconds.

```ruby
MyActiveResource.cached_resource.ttl = 60
```

Enable cache expiry time randomization, allowing it to fall randomly between 60 and 120 seconds.

```ruby
MyActiveResource.cached_resource.ttl_randomization = true
```

Change the cache expiry time randomization scale so that the cache expiry time falls randomly between 30 and 180 seconds.

```ruby
MyActiveResource.cached_resource.ttl_randomization_scale = 0.5..3
```
Enable collection synchronization.  This will cause a call to `MyActiveResource.all` to also create cache entries for each of its members.  So, for example, a later call to `MyActiveResource.find(1)` will be read from the cache instead of requested from the remote service.

```ruby
MyActiveResource.cached_resource.collection_synchronize = true
```
Change the arguments that identify the principal collection request.  If for some reason you are concerned with a collection that is retrieved at a "non-standard" URL, you may specify the Ruby arguments that produce that URL.  When `collection_synchronize` is `true`, the collection returned from a request that matches these arguments will be cached and later updated when one of its members or a subset is retrieved.

```ruby
MyActiveResource.cached_resource.collection_arguments = [:all, :params => {:name => "Bob"}]
```
Set a different logger.

```ruby
MyActiveResource.cached_resource.logger = MyLogger.new
```
Set a different cache store.

```ruby
MyActiveResource.cached_resource.cache = MyCacheStore.new
```

### Caveats
If you set up CachedResource across all ActiveResources or any subclass of ActiveResource that will be inherited by other classes and you want some of those others to have independent CachedResource configurations, then check out the example below:

```ruby
class ActiveResource::Base
  cached_resource
end
```

```ruby
class MyActiveResource < ActiveResource::Base
  self.cached_resource = CachedResource::Configuration.new(:collection_synchronize => true)
end
```
## Usage
Sit back and relax! If you need to reload a particular request you can pass `:reload => true` into the options hash like this:

```ruby
MyActiveResource.find(:all, :reload => true)
```
If you need to clear the entire cache just do the following:

```ruby
MyActiveResource.clear_cache
```
---
Sometimes you might have a case the resource pathing is non-unique per call. This can create a situation where your caching the same result for multiple calls:

```ruby
MyActiveResource.find(:one, from: "/admin/shop.json")
```

Since resources are cached with an argument based key, you may pass in extra data to be appended to the cache key:

```ruby
MyActiveResource.find(:one, from: "/admin/shop.json", uid: "unique value")
```
## Testing

```ruby
rake
```

or to test all supported environments, make sure appraisal is setup

```ruby
bundle exec appraisal install
```

and then run

```ruby
bundle exec appraisal rake
```
